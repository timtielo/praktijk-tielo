    "paragraph1": "Competitive swimming, rowing, boxing, and fitness. Definitely sporty. Because of this, I have always been concerned with health.",
    "paragraph2": "But in 2019, something suddenly changed. Unexplainable fatigue: I slept, went to school, and slept. I was forgetful and had no emotion, it was as if I wasn't present. From blood tests to heart examinations, and then ending up at the Medical Training Center to learn to live with the complaints. No solution, simply learning to live with it.",
    "paragraph3": "I wasn't satisfied with that, which didn't always make it easy. After a few months, I heard through the grapevine about an alternative treatment method. I was extremely skeptical: 'this can never work'. And I still don't completely understand it, but that's not necessary. It worked.",
    "paragraph4": "From this piece of powerlessness, dissatisfaction, hope, and ultimately a solution, my dream grew to be able to mean the same for people. That's why I started Praktijk Tielo, hoping to help you further as well.",
